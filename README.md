A project from [freecodecamp's frontend certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) that calls a [free public API](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373) to get inspirational quotes.
